Intern Performance Prediction
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting intern performance using Logistic Regression based on key features such as Attendance Rate, Tasks Completed, Feedback Score, and Engagement Score. The objective is to understand which factors influence intern success and to gain practical experience with machine learning workflows.

Key Highlights

Model: Logistic Regression

Performance:

Accuracy: 82.5%

ROC-AUC Score: 0.93

Key Features: AttendanceRate and TasksCompleted were found to be the most influential predictors.

Dataset

The repository includes the raw intern dataset with numeric features and the target PerformanceFlag.

No preprocessing is applied in the raw file.

Code

Contains Python scripts for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

Learning Outcome

This project was completed under mentor guidance, allowing hands-on experience with:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Scaling and Preprocessing

Logistic Regression Training and Evaluation

Model Interpretation and Visualization

How to Run
